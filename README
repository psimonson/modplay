=================================================
I wrote this to be a simple mod file player for
Windows/Linux/MacOS. Although I haven't tested
on Windows/MacOS, yet. But I will, right now
everything that I wanted is implemented. You can
change the current song. With previous/next keys
and you can play, stop, pause, and resume play-
ing. Below are the keys for doing so...
=================================================
          .:[CURRENT KEY BINDINGS]:.
=================================================
 P      - Play the current file.
 S      - Stop playing of current file.
 O      - Pause/Resume playing of current file.
 N      - Go to the next song.
 B      - Go to the previous song.
 Escape - Quit this application.
